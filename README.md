# CLEX

## Project status

The CLEX File Manager is an old software.
It exists as an open source project since January 2002.
The last major release is dated 2011.
No new features will be added, we only fix bugs.

Many users are still using it and we appreciate that.
But if you came here looking for a file manager and do not
need a lightweight terminal based program, choose a modern
file manager instead.

## Description

CLEX is a file manager with a full-screen user interface written
in C with the curses library.

It displays directory contents (including file status details)
and provides features like command history, filename insertion,
or name completion in order to help the user to construct commands
to be executed by the shell (there are no built-in commands).

CLEX is easily configurable and all its features are explained
in the on-line help.

## License

CLEX is free software without warranty of any kind; see the
GNU General Public License as set out in the "COPYING" document
which accompanies the CLEX File Manager package.
