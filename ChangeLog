* * * CLEX Revision History * * *

4.7 released on 15-AUG-2022

  Important announcement:
    * CLEX has moved to GitHub, all links were updated. The
      new project home is https://github.com/xitop/clex

  Problems fixed:
    * Fixed a build issue on MacOS. It was related to wide
      characters in the ncurses library. Patch provided by
      a maintainer from MacPorts.


4.6.patch10 released on 30-SEP-2020

  Problems fixed:
    * Under certain rare circumstances (more than 384 different
      directories visited) the displayed directory names did not
      match the names stored in the panel.

  New or improved functionality:
    * The sort panel actions are described more accurately.
    * Pressing ctrl-C now leaves the config panel.


4.6.patch9 released on 08-JUN-2018

  New or improved functionality:
    * Support for GPM mouse and other mice was added
      when compiled with NCURSES version 6.0 or newer.


4.6.patch8 released on 05-MAY-2018

  Problems fixed:
    * Some typos were corrected. Thanks to Tobias Frost
      for sending a patch.

  New or improved functionality:
    * The 'configure' script was modified so that CLEX compiles
      without warnings with recent gcc and glibc versions.


4.6.patch7 released on 23-JUN-2017

  Problems fixed:
    * Non-ASCII - but printable - Unicode characters are now
      allowed in the xterm window title.
    * A backtick character inside of double quotes is now
      properly quoted.
    * Attempts to insert an Alt-key combination into the
      editing line (i.e. Ctrl-V Alt-X) invoked the function
      bound to that Alt-key combination. This is now fixed.

  New or improved functionality:
    * Mouse clicks on the top (bottom) frame scroll the panel
      one page up (down) respectively. Panel filter control
      with a mouse was removed in order not to interfere with
      the new page down function.
    * The file rename function does not replace spaces
      with underscores.
    * The Unicode non-breaking space (NBSP) is marked as a special
      character. Shells do not treat this character as a separator.
      Commands containing NBSP written by mistake usually fail
      and the error is not easy to find.
    * User and group names up to 16 characters are displayed
      without truncating in the file panel. (The limit was
      9 characters)
    * User names are never truncated in the user panel.
    * The RPM spec file is now included in the source code
      tarball. Previously this file has to be downloaded
      separately or built from a provided template. This extra
      step is now unnecessary and an RPM package can be built
      simply with:  rpmbuild -tb clex.X.Y.Z.tar.gz


4.6.patch6 released on 31-AUG-2013

  Problems fixed:
     * Several wide character buffer sizes were computed in
       incorrect units. No buffer overflows were actually
       occurring, but such code is not usable if compiled with
       protection against overflows, e.g. with gcc and
       FORTIFY_SOURCE=2. Problem noted and a fix proposed by
       Rudolf Polzer.
     * A bug in the file I/O error reporting code of the
       directory compare function was found by Rudolf Polzer.

  New or improved functionality:
     * New setting in the sort panel: hidden files can be
       excluded from the file list.


4.6.patch5 released on 19-JUL-2011

  Problems fixed:
     * Some keys did not work in the log panel's filter.


4.6.4 released on 21-MAY-2011

  Problems fixed:
     * Name completion did not expand a single tilde as a home 
       directory.
     * A mouseclick on a certain screen area of the help panel
       could lead to a crash.

  New or improved functionality:
     * The English documentation was proofread and corrected,
       the service was kindly contributed by Richard Harris.
     * Text file preview function was added.
     * The initial working directory for the secondary file
       panel is now set by a bookmark named DIR2. This
       replaces the configuration parameter DIR2.
     * The initial working directory for the primary file
       panel can be now set by a bookmark named DIR1.
     * New configuration parameter TIME_DATE controls the
       display of date and time.
     * Changes to the mouse control were made.
     * The recommendation against using alt-R for normal file 
       renaming was dropped.


4.5 released on 24-SEP-2009

  Problems fixed:
     * Name completion could not complete user and group names
       containing a dot, comma or a dash character.

  New or improved functionality:
     * A mouse is supported on xterm-compatible terminals.
     * The location of configuration files has been moved
       again in order to comply with the XDG Specification.
       The standard place for these files is from now on the
       ~/.config/clex directory. Use the 'cfg-clex' utility to
       move the files to the new location.
     * There is a new option in the completion panel which
       allows completion of a name which is a part of a longer
       word. The option has a self-explaining description:
       'name to be completed starts at the cursor position'.
     * Configuration parameter C_PANEL_SIZE (completion panel
       size) cannot be set to AUTO (screen size) because this
       size is often uncomfortably small.
     * The Unicode soft hyphen character is displayed as a
       control character.
     * In the history panel a command separator is
       automatically inserted into the input line when a
       command is appended to the end of another command.
     * Configuration parameters CMD_Fn accept a new control
       sequence $~ which disables the 'Press enter to
       continue' prompt. The control is returned to CLEX
       immediately after the command execution terminates
       provided that:

          * the command has not been modified; and
          * the command terminates successfully (exit code
            zero).

     * The $! control sequence can appear anywhere in a
       configuration parameter CMD_Fn, not only at the end.
     * New function: alt-Z places the current line to the
       center of the panel. People using cluster-ssh might
       find it useful.


4.4 released on 07-APR-2009

  Problems fixed:
     * In the help text there were few Unicode characters which
       are now eliminated because they could not be displayed
       properly in non-Unicode encodings.

  New or improved functionality:
     * New function was added: change into a subdirectory
       showing the contents in the other file panel (alt-X).
       This function allows a return into the original
       directory simply by switching panels (ctrl-X).


4.3 released on 29-MAR-2009

  Problems fixed:
     * A newly added bookmark did not appear on the screen
       immediately.
     * A misleading message 'Ignoring the DIR2 configuration
       parameter' was logged when the 'DIR2' was set to
       'HOME'.

  New or improved functionality:
     * The bookmark organizer has been merged with the regular
       bookmark panel.
     * Bookmarks can have descriptive names.
     * The current working directory can be bookmarked from
       the file panel (ctrl-D).
     * The 'B_PANEL_SIZE' config parameter was removed.


4.2 released on 15-MAR-2009

  Problems fixed:
     * In some cases the 'cfg-clex' utility was generating an
       unusable template for the copy command (F5).
     * Under certain circumstances a crash was occurring on
       exit when CLEX was used over a ssh connection.

  New or improved functionality:
     * All configuration files now reside in the .clex
       subdirectory. Use the 'cfg-clex' utility to move the
       files to new location.


4.1 released on 09-FEB-2009

  Problems fixed:
     * Usage of uninitialized memory during the start-up has
       been corrected. It caused a crash on the Apple Mac OS X
       platform. Systems where CLEX starts normally are not
       affected by this bug.
     * A compilation problem on Apple Mac OS X was fixed.
     * The xterm title change feature did not work on remote
       telnet or ssh connections.

  New or improved functionality:
     * If a directory comparison is restricted to regular
       files, then only information about this type of file is
       displayed in the summary.
     * A small program named 'kbd-test' was added. It is a
       utility for troubleshooting keyboard related problems.


CLEX 4.0 released on 22-DEC-2008

   This is the initial release of the CLEX 4 branch. Main new
   features are:
     * Unicode support was implemented.
     * Several configuration parameters have been converted to options
       which are saved automatically.
     * The log panel and optional logging to a file for auditing and
       troubleshooting were added.
     * There is now 'cfg-clex' utility.
     * A built-in function for renaming files with invalid or
       unprintable characters was added.
   Enhancements (compared to previous releases) include:
     * Configuring prompt, time format and date format is more flexible.
     * The help is not limited to one link per line.
     * The user interface of the directory compare function was redesigned.
     * Changes in the pattern matching routine were made
     * Panel filtering is now available in two more panels.
     * A new tool for inserting control characters into the input line
       was added.
