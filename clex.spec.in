%description
CLEX (pronounced KLEKS) is a file manager with a full-screen user 
interface. It displays directory contents including the file status 
details and provides features like command history, filename insertion, 
or name completion in order to help users to create commands to be 
executed by the shell. 

CLEX is a versatile tool for system administrators and all users that 
utilize the enormous power of the command line. Its unique one-panel 
user interface enhances productivity and lessens the probability of 
mistake. There are no built-in commands, CLEX is an add-on to your 
favorite shell.
